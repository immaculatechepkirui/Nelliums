Title 
"Hello, I am Immaculate Chepkirui. Nelliums is 'Unravelling Africa’s sovereign debt crisis — path to sustainability.' This work turns public fiscal datasets into actionable analysis for policymakers."

General Overview 
"Fiscal stability is central to inclusive development. Many countries face persistent deficits and rising debt. This project seeks to extract signals from the provided dataset to inform policy."

Objective 
"My objective was to compute key indicators—debt-to-GDP, trade balance, expenditure shares—and build scenario projections to guide policy trade-offs."

Data & Methods 
"I ingest the public Google Sheet as CSV, clean columns, infer dates/numerics, compute indicators, and use a deterministic debt identity for projections."

Expected Outcome
"Deliverables: reproducible notebook, cleaned dataset, projection CSV, and slides with policy recommendations."

Tools 
"I used Python in Jupyter with pandas, numpy, matplotlib/seaborn and plotly for charts."

Key Results 
"Baseline projection (assumptions: initial debt 70.0%, growth 3.0%, interest 5.0%, primary balance -1.0%): debt-to-GDP moves from 70.0% to 95.8% over 10 years. This illustrates the sensitivity of debt dynamics to the interest-growth differential and persistent deficits."

Policy Recommendations 
"Strengthen revenue, protect social spending, manage debt composition, and create an automated monitoring dashboard."

Limitations & Next Steps 
"Model simplifications (no maturity structure, no stochastic shocks). Next steps: maturity-structured simulation, stochastic scenarios, interactive dashboard."

Criteria Mapping
"This project meets the rubric: documented analysis, clear visuals, policy-ready insights, and reproducible code. Thank you; I’m happy to share the repository and answer questions."
